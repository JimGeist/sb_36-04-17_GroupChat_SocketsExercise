## Technology Stack
- **Front-end**: JavaScript
- **Back-end**: Node.js

Focus of the exercise was to explore good OO design for a sophisticated application and also to get hands-on practice with websockets.

"*The goal of this exercise is to read and understand the code, if youâ€™d like, there are some additional features you can implement.*"

## Additional Details

**Enhancements**
- I truly regret to say that I did not go the route of adding some of the suggested additional features. The starter code provided will hopefully provide a strong code base for me to review and practice with in the future.
